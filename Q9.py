#Convert temperature in celsius to temperature in fahrenheit

C = float(input('What is the temperature in celsius? '))#set C to the value the user enters and cast it into float
F = 9/5 * C + 32#we need a '*' for multiplication
print("The temperature in fahrenheit is ",F)#we need '()' and ',' to complete printing
